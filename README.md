# Hospital Readmission Prediction

Hospital Readmission (HR) rates have increased over the last years, and impose a huge economic burden on healthcare institutions. Even though many works have been done on the development of machine learning-based predictive models for these events, few models provide high discriminative ability. Three main drawbacks can be identified in the published literature: imbalanced target features, not including demographic and lifestyle predictors, and lack of interpretability of the models. In this work, we approach the prediction of HR trying to solve these issues by evaluating feature balancing techniques, performing a feature selection process including demographic and lifestyle features, and utilizing the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) posthoc methods of interpretability. Our final XGBoost classifier including 1296 predictors obtains excellent predictive capabilities, reaching an Area Under the Curve of 0.849. The importance of age, the number of long-term conditions, and the duration of the first admission are found through the SHAP and ALE techniques. In addition, an ablation study was carried out and showed 
that demographic and lifestyle features provide even better predictive capabilities than other features, suggesting their relevance toward HR.
